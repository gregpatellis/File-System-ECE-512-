# File-System-ECE-512-
This is written in BCPL and creates a file system responsive to user commands outlined in the documentation section at the beginning of the program. Utilizes a single level organization where meta data is stored in the super-block, and file information and pointers are stored in the root directory. Each file contains a header block as well that contains file information and pointers to data blocks.
